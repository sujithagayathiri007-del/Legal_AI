AI Legal Intelligence Agent 

Overview
AI Legal Intelligence Agent is a web-based prototype designed to simulate structured legal case analysis using a multi-agent reasoning framework.
The platform demonstrates how artificial intelligence can assist in organizing legal information, identifying key issues, mapping relevant laws, and estimating litigation risk in a structured and explainable format.

Project Description
This prototype analyzes legal case descriptions and generates structured insights including:

Case Summary
Key Legal Issues

Applicable Laws and Sections
Risk Assessment
Probability-based Possible Outcomes
Bias Detection Indicators
The system follows a conceptual multi-agent architecture to simulate intelligent legal reasoning workflows.

Architecture Concept
The platform is based on a four-agent analytical model:
Case Summarizer Agent
Produces a concise and neutral summary of the case.
Legal Issue Identifier Agent
Extracts and structures the primary legal disputes involved.
Law Mapping Agent
Maps identified issues to relevant Indian legal provisions.
Risk Analysis Agent
Evaluates litigation risk and predicts possible outcomes with probability estimates.
This version focuses on demonstrating structured reasoning flow and user interface design rather than full backend AI deployment.

User Interface
The prototype is built using Lovable Cloud and includes:
Structured dashboard layout
Multi-section analysis display
Risk-level visualization (Low / Medium / High)
Probability breakdown of possible outcomes
Bias detection section
PDF export simulation
Dark mode interface
The design reflects a professional legal technology platform.

Features
Structured legal reasoning simulation
Civil and criminal case analysis examples
Risk probability modeling

Law section referencing (BNS, IPC, Contract Act, etc.)
Clean and minimal legal-tech interface
Legal Framework Coverage (Simulated)
The prototype demonstrates references to:
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (2023)
Indian Penal Code (1860)
Indian Contract Act (1872)
Sale of Goods Act (1930)
Code of Criminal Procedure / BNSS
Indian Evidence Act
Deployment
This prototype is hosted using Lovable Cloud platform.

Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how a multi-agent AI reasoning model can assist in structured legal case analysis and risk estimation.
